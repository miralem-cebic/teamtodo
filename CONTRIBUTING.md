# Contributing to teamtodo

Thank you for taking the time to contribute. This document describes how to propose changes, what we expect from a pull request, and how releases are made.

By participating in this project you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Ways to contribute

- **Report bugs** using the [bug report template](https://github.com/miralem-cebic/teamtodo/issues/new?template=bug_report.yml).
- **Suggest features** using the [feature request template](https://github.com/miralem-cebic/teamtodo/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml).
- **Improve documentation**, typos and unclear wording included.
- **Submit code** via pull requests.

For security issues, do not open a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## Workflow

`main` is protected. Every change reaches it through a pull request:

1. **Discuss first** for anything larger than a small fix. Open an issue or comment on an existing one.
2. **Fork** the repository (or create a branch if you have write access).
3. **Create a branch** with a descriptive name, for example `feat/task-due-dates` or `fix/export-encoding`.
4. **Make your change** and keep it focused. One pull request should solve one problem.
5. **Commit** using [Conventional Commits](#commit-messages).
6. **Open a pull request** against `main` and fill in the template.
7. **Pass all checks.** CI must be green before a pull request can be merged.
8. **Get a review.** At least one maintainer approval is required.
9. **Merge.** We use squash merges, so the pull request title becomes the commit message on `main`.

## Commit messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). The pull request title must follow the same format, because it becomes the commit message after a squash merge and is used for release notes.

```text
<type>(<optional scope>): <short summary>
```

Allowed types:

| Type       | What it is for                               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `feat`     | A new feature                                |
| `fix`      | A bug fix                                    |
| `docs`     | Documentation only                           |
| `refactor` | Restructuring code without changing behavior |
| `perf`     | Performance improvement                      |
| `test`     | Adding or fixing tests                       |
| `build`    | Build system or dependency changes           |
| `ci`       | CI configuration                             |
| `style`    | Formatting only, no logic change             |
| `chore`    | Maintenance that does not fit elsewhere      |
| `revert`   | Reverting a previous commit                  |

Breaking changes are marked with `!` after the type (for example `feat!: change data file format`) and explained in the pull request body.

Examples:

- `feat: add due dates to tasks`
- `fix(storage): handle files locked by OneDrive sync`
- `docs: clarify how to share the data folder`

## Coding guidelines

Set up the project and run the same checks as CI before you push (see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md) for details):

```bash
npm ci
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

- Keep changes small and focused. Avoid unrelated refactoring in the same pull request.
- Match the style of the surrounding code and existing naming conventions.
- Add or update tests for behavior you change.
- Update the documentation when behavior changes.
- Do not commit generated files, secrets, or local configuration. The `.gitignore` covers the common cases.
- Editor settings are shared via [`.editorconfig`](.editorconfig).
- The app's user interface and code comments are currently in German. New text should follow the language of the surrounding code, and translating the UI is welcome in its own pull request.

## Pull request checklist

Before requesting a review, make sure that:

- [ ] The PR title follows Conventional Commits.
- [ ] Tests pass locally and in CI.
- [ ] New behavior is covered by tests.
- [ ] Documentation and the changelog are updated where relevant (`## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md`).
- [ ] Breaking changes are called out in the description.

## Labels

Labels are used to sort the release notes automatically (see [`.github/release.yml`](.github/release.yml)):

| Label                         | Release notes section |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| `breaking-change`             | Breaking changes      |
| `enhancement`, `feature`      | Features              |
| `bug`                         | Bug fixes             |
| `documentation`               | Documentation         |
| `chore`, `dependencies`, `ci` | Maintenance           |
| `ignore-for-release`          | Excluded from notes   |

## Releasing

Releases are created by maintainers. A release is published when a version tag is pushed.

1. Make sure `main` is green and all planned changes are merged.
2. In `CHANGELOG.md`, rename `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and add a new empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it.
3. Merge that change through a pull request.
4. Create and push a tag on the resulting commit on `main`:

   ```bash
   git switch main && git pull
   git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release vX.Y.Z"
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```

The [release workflow](.github/workflows/release.yml) then:

- refuses to release tags that do not point to a commit on `main`,
- builds the package and its SHA-256 checksum,
- publishes a GitHub release with the changelog section and the generated release notes.

Tags containing a hyphen (for example `v1.2.0-rc.1`) are published as pre-releases.

## Repository settings (maintainers)

These settings live in the GitHub UI and are not stored in the repository. Maintainers should configure them as follows.

**Branch protection or ruleset for `main`:**

- Require a pull request before merging, with at least 1 approving review.
- Dismiss stale approvals when new commits are pushed.
- Require status checks to pass: `pr-title`, `markdown-lint`, and `build / package`.
- Require branches to be up to date before merging.
- Require conversation resolution before merging.
- Require linear history and allow only squash merges.
- Block force pushes and deletions.

**Tag ruleset for `v*`:** restrict tag creation to maintainers so that only approved releases are published.

**Other settings:**

- Enable private vulnerability reporting under *Security*.
- Enable automatic deletion of head branches after merge.
- Set the repository description, website, and topics.
